# roistat-test

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

P.S. I didn`t use SASS preprocessor because the task is small enough to be happy with plain css
